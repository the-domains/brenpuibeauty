  Antioxidants and Premature Aging: Mulberries also boast a high level of
  vitamin A and vitamin E, as along with a range of carotenoid components like
  lutein, beta carotene, zea-xanthin, and alpha carotene. All of these elements
  act as antioxidants that specifically affect the skin, tissue,hair, and other
  areas of the body where free radicals strike. Mulberries can help keep skin
  looking smooth, reduce the appearance of blemishes and age spots, and keep
  hair shiny and healthy by preventing the oxidative actions of free radicals.
